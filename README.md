# Image Super Resolution using AutoEncoders in Keras

## Description:

Image Super Resolution is a technique to increase the resolution of an image using Deep Learning model, which in this case is by using the autoencoders from the keras package.

The project currently aims to enchance the images from the car image dataset. Future scope of this project is to implement for various other images of different subject.

## Requirements:

### Setup an environment:

For Unix based systems please execute the following command to create venv and install requirements.

```
make init
source .venv/bin/activate
```

For windows users,

```
py -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage:

After setting up the environment, Run the main.py to kickstart the project

```
$> python3 main.py
```
